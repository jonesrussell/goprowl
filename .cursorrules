Always use the project's import path github.com/jonesrussell/goprowl
Always implement proper interface abstractions following Go best practices
Always use uber-fx for dependency injection and application lifecycle management
Utilize colly/v2 for web crawling
Always use bleve/v2 for search engine functionality
Always use sync.RWMutex for concurrent operations in storage implementations
Always implement proper error handling and avoid panics
Always use context.Context for cancellation and timeouts
Never skip error handling
Never use init() functions except for fx.Module registration
Run code through golangci-lint before suggesting changes

Files named types.go should only contain interface and type definitions

The separation of concerns is now:
search/engine/types.go: Interface and type definitions
search/engine/query.go: Query parsing and processing
search/engine/basic_search.go: Search implementation and relevancy calculation
